## My process

In this project, I utilized Vite for a fast and efficient development environment, paired with React for building the UI components, and Tailwind CSS to handle the responsive design. Tailwind CSS was particularly useful in ensuring the application's responsiveness across different devices without relying on additional third-party libraries for design.

A key focus of this project was to implement the core functionality using custom logic, avoiding external npm packages where possible to achieve similar features. The only exception was the use of routing, which is essential for navigation, but beyond that, the project is built with a strong emphasis on custom solutions. This approach allowed me to have full control over the logic and design, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

To building this helps me to logic with the component state and logic.
